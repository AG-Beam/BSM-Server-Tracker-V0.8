》 Built for Minecraft Version 1.20.4 as an add-on to my client so i am able to track certain <br />
	players then ended up making a Server tracker with a large amount of settings to find set servers <br />
	that are able to be griefed or whitelist bypassed. <br />
》Someone sent me ServerSeeker and it gave me some ideas for checking servers for cracked accounts <br />
	then i added a password cracker ( weak but will be updated ) and was able to crack 2 accounts well testing <br />
	due note these are my alts that were created for these tests no player accounts have been cracked during the process <br />
	it was just for testing incase i forget one of my passwords<br />
